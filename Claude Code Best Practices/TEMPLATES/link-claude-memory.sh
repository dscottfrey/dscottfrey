#
# WHAT THIS DOES:
#   Symlinks this machine's Claude Code per-project memory directory
#   to the copy of memory files kept in this repo (`.claude/memory/`).
#   Run once per machine after cloning the repo.
#
# WHY:
#   Claude Code stores per-project memory at
#     ~/.claude/projects/<encoded-project-path>/memory/
#   By default that directory is machine-local, so facts the assistant
#   learns on the desktop don't reach the laptop and vice versa. [Project Name]
#   is directed by a single owner across two machines — memory should
#   be a single source of truth, shared via git like every other piece
#   of project context.
#
# HOW THE ENCODING WORKS:
#   Claude Code takes the absolute path to the project root and
#   replaces every `/` with `-`. Spaces are kept as-is. So
#     /Users/<you>/Code/My Project
#   becomes
#     -Users-<you>-Code-My Project
#   which is the folder name under ~/.claude/projects/.
#
# SAFETY:
#   If a non-symlink memory directory already exists on this machine,
#   we move it to a .bak suffix so nothing is lost. If a symlink is
#   already in place (you're re-running the script), we replace it.
